# liri-node-app
This is a node.js app that searches 3 different api's for information about; your favorite bands concert information, your favorite movies information, as well as the information on your favorite song. You can use the spotify api by adding spotify-this to the call and adding your favorite song you get info on that song as in the artist and a link to spotify to take a listen. 

When looking for a good movie add movie-this to the end of your call and add an interesting movie to get information about that movie, like the actors as well as the year it was released. If bands are your thing use concert-this after the call with the name of your favorite band and find information on the next concert they are playing as well as the location in case you are looking to travel for that band.
